# Business Plan

## Executive Summary
Our platform will pair a hyperlocal marketplace with a hyperlocal company directory. The marketplace, intended to drive traffic to the site and associated directory, will be offered for free. Companies will be charged an annual fee of $50 for listings, but we'll offer a limited number of lifetime listings for free as part of our pre-launch promotion. We'll also sell advertising on the marketplace and provide preferential placement for companies that pay an additional fee. 

## Company Description
We are a platform that connects local businesses with local consumers, aiming to boost the visibility and reach of local enterprises while providing consumers with a curated list of local businesses and services.

## Business Objectives

- Develop a self-sustaining, profitable business within two years.
- Offer lifetime listings for free to early adopters to foster community building and drive early adoption.
- Sell at least 5 company listings per month during the first year and grow at a rate of 10% annually.
- Secure at least 25% occupancy of preferential placement spots on an ongoing basis.

## Business Model

### Revenue Streams

1. **Company Listings:** Businesses will be charged $50 per year for a standard listing in our directory. Prior to the platform's launch, lifetime listings will be given away for free to attract early adopters and stimulate growth.

2. **Preferential Placement:** Businesses can pay an additional $200 per year for preferential placement within their respective category. We expect to sell a quarter of these premium spots on a continuous basis.

3. **Advertising:** The platform will host two ads per page. Pricing for ad space will start at $100 per month, scaling as site traffic increases. Advertising services will include:
   * **Tiered Pricing:** Different tiers of ad spaces will be available, with prime locations being sold at a premium rate.
   * **Pay-Per-Click (PPC) or Cost-Per-Impression (CPM) Models:** Advertisers will have the option to pay based on the number of clicks or impressions their ad receives.
   * **Targeted Advertising:** Advertisers can target their ads to specific categories or geographical locations on the platform.
   * **Sponsored Content:** Businesses will have the opportunity to feature sponsored content such as blog posts, articles, or videos on the site.
   * **Affiliate Marketing:** Affiliate deals may be available for businesses selling products or services online.
   * **Bundle Advertising with Other Services:** If a business purchases a company listing or preferential placement, they will be offered a discount on advertising packages.



## Market Analysis
### Market Trends
With the rising trend of 'shopping local' and supporting community businesses, a platform that easily connects consumers with local enterprises can capitalize on this movement.
### Target Market
Our target market includes all local businesses in the area that could benefit from increased visibility and consumers looking for a convenient way to discover and support local businesses.
### Competitors
We'll face competition from general business directories and other local marketplaces. Our USP is the pairing of a hyperlocal marketplace with a company directory and our focus on supporting local businesses.

## Organization and Management
### Organizational Structure
One guy doing all the work

### Management Team
The management team will be responsible for overseeing the operations, marketing, sales, and customer support aspects of the business.

## Services
Our primary services include the company directory listing and marketplace advertising. Additional paid services include preferential placement in listings.

## Marketing and Sales Strategy
Our initial sales strategy is to sign up as many businesses as possible before launch through cold calling and local marketing at fairs and community events. Post-launch, the marketplace will be promoted in a similar fashion. Additionally, we'll utilize online marketing channels such as social media, SEO, and email marketing. The free marketplace is expected to act as a major draw for consumers, which in turn should make listing and advertising on the platform attractive to local businesses. We will stress our customer support accessability
as a selling point, "Just give us a call if you have any problems".


## 4. Financial Projections

### 4.1 Startup Costs

- Legal entity setup: $200

### 4.2 Operating Costs

- Monthly server costs (3 VPS): $30 x 12 = $360 annually

### 4.3 Revenue Streams

#### 4.3.1 Company Listings

- $50 per year
- Estimated 5 listings sold per month in the first year: $50 x 5 x 12 = $3,000

#### 4.3.2 Preferential Placement

Preferential Placement will be rolled out in short order and does not require the same critical mass that other forms of advertising like the CPM model requires.

- $100 per month
- 25% occupancy of preferential spots: $100 x 0.25 x 20 x 12 = $6,000 (Assuming 20 categories)

#### 4.3.3 Advertising

Here are the potential sources of advertising revenue:

- **Basic Ad Spots:** These are your regular ad spots that businesses can purchase for $100 per month. They're visible, but they're not as prominent as the premium ad spots. These could be small banner ads, side panel ads, etc.

- **Premium Ad Spots:** These spots are more visible or desirable for advertisers. They're positioned in prime locations on your webpage—like at the top of the page, or between sections of content—where they're more likely to catch a visitor's attention. These spots cost $150 per month, more than the basic spots due to their prime location.

- **Pay-Per-Click (PPC) or Cost-Per-Impression (CPM) Models:** Instead of a fixed price, some ads will generate revenue based on user interaction. Pay-per-click means you earn revenue each time a visitor clicks on the ad, while cost-per-impression means you earn revenue based on the number of times the ad is displayed or seen by visitors. The earnings from these models can vary greatly, but for simplicity, we're estimating an average income of $100 per month from these ads.



- **Additional sources (Targeted Advertising, Sponsored Content, Affiliate Marketing, and Bundle Deals):** These are other various methods of advertising. For example, targeted advertising could involve showing specific ads to users based on their browsing habits or demographics, sponsored content could involve hosting content that promotes a particular business or product, affiliate marketing involves promoting others' products and earning a commission, and bundle deals could involve selling ad spots in bulk at a discount. We're conservatively estimating these sources to bring in an additional $200 per month.


Given that there are two ad spots on every page, the monthly revenue from advertising could be: $100 (basic) + $150 (premium) + $100 (PPC/CPM) + $200 (additional sources) = $550 per ad spot. Given two ad spots per page, this would total to $1,100/month or $13,200 annually.





### 4.4 Summary

- Year 1 Revenue: $3,000 (listings) + $1,000 (preferential) + $13,200 (ads) = $17,200
- Year 1 Operating costs: $360
- Year 1 Profit before tax: $16,840

(Note: These projections assume that all estimates are accurate and do not account for taxes or potential additional costs that may arise. It also assumes all ads are sold out throughout the year.)

# Business Model Appendix

## Implementing a Cost Per Impression (CPM) Model

Implementing a Cost Per Impression (CPM) model in your advertising platform requires a way to track and count the number of times an advertisement is served and displayed on a webpage, regardless of whether it is clicked or not. Here's a high-level overview of how you could implement this:

1. **Ad Serving and Tracking:** Each time a webpage is loaded, the server would select an ad from your database to display, and then log that impression in your database. Typically, the ad selection process is handled by an ad server, which could be a third-party service or a custom-built solution. The ad server is responsible for selecting ads based on various criteria, such as the user's location, the targeting preferences of the advertiser, and so on.

2. **Impression Logging:** Whenever an ad is served, an entry should be created in an impressions table in your database. This table could include information like the ID of the ad, the time it was displayed, the page it was displayed on, and potentially other information about the user, like their IP address or a unique user identifier.

3. **Billing:** At the end of the billing period, you would calculate the total number of impressions for each ad and charge the advertiser accordingly. For example, if you were charging $1 per 1000 impressions (a common CPM rate), and an ad was displayed 100,000 times in a month, you would charge the advertiser $100.

4. **Reporting:** Provide reports to your advertisers showing how many impressions their ads received. This could be a simple table in a monthly email, or a more sophisticated dashboard in your web app showing daily impressions and trends over time.
